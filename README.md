Event Layer:

0 = villages
1 = towers
2 = castles
3 = ruins
4 = deep forest areas
5 = inland lake areas
6 = mountain areas
7 = ocean shorelines
8 = forest edges
9 = hills
10 = rough ground


Obvious bugs to fix:
On new path the armys start position jumps towards the goal.

TODO today:
Cleanup roles, like entity movable etc.
Implement a quadtree for checking collisions.
Populate the quadtree with characters and armies.
Create characters in the map, moving about from towns to towers to villages to fields, depending on professions.
Hunters exist in the forest etc. There should be many many independants, this "many" thing shoudl be a big part of the game interaction.
Each character should have a home. So villages are important.
